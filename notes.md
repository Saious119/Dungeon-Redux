# TODO FOR MONOGAME
## Convert DFA image in to monogame functions

# TODO IN GENERAL
## Flavor text function
have each enemy have a flavor text function that can be called on the creation of the enemy to give special text like for the start of boss fights
## Spell effects funtion
Have each spell have a type, if its an effect type then an effects function is called when its cast
The effects funtion takes a reference to the player and the enemy and applies its buffs or debuffs or what ever other effects
this will make spells more generic and easier to be varried.
